# How to set up the project (and test things out)
After cloning the project and doing an npm install, run `npx nodemon` to start the development server. Then, navigate to `127.0.0.1:8080` and feel free to test things out!

## Testing Notes
1. The keybinds for the gameplay is `Q`, `W`, `O`, and `P`, where q is the first column, w is the second, and so on.
2. I'm working on synchronizing the beatmaps in the (incomplete) Conductor class, but that's still a work-in-progress.
3. In the meantime, beatmaps `001` and `003` ("Illness LiLin" and "Destroy the Wired") are the easier beatmaps of the three, as `002` (Let's All Love Lain) is currently only available on Insane difficulty, while the other two are on Novice/Normal and Hard.
